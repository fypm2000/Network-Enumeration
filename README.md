# Network-Enumeration

## Objective

The objective of this project was to perform a comprehensive network security assessment within a VM Lab environment. The main goal was to identify and analyze potential vulnerabilities and security weaknesses across the network infrastructure without compromising the integrity or stability of any systems. This assessment aimed to enhance knowledge and proficiency in network security principles and methodologies through practical application and analysis of scan results.

### Skills Learned

- Utilization of network scanning tools.
- Analysis of open ports and services to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Understanding of security headers and their importance in web server security.
- Interpretation of scan results to assess network security posture.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.

### Tools Used

- Nmap, a versatile network scanning tool for discovering hosts, open ports, and services on a network
- Sparta, a Python-based GUI application for simplifying network penetration testing, offering streamlined access to various tools and scan results organization.

## Steps
Sparta Initial Scan Results

This screenshot shows the initial findings of open services across the network, including HTTP, Microsoft Terminal Services, and specialized services like pcAnywhere (pcduo) and CodeMeter. It demonstrates the range of initial targets identified for further exploration and potential vulnerabilities.
